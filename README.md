# Image Captioning

This project provides a pre-trained model and source code for generating descriptions of images.

### Download Model

You can download the pre-trained model [here](https://mega.nz/file/TkMkyYgC#NpL8WcKHMsYEMf-QCikFuIKk3A7_061KbXuziCraPZs). The model is trained on the MSCOCO-2014 dataset.

The directory contains two sub-directories:
- `photos`: Store all input images here.
- `results`: Output log files are stored here.

### Generating Captions

Run the `imageCaptioning.ipynb` file to generate captions for images.

### Example

For example, the image `plane.jpeg` generates the following captions:
```
./photos/plane.jpeg
0): a plane is flying in blue sky.
1): a plane is flying in cloudy sky.
2): a plane is flying in blue and cloudy sky.
```
